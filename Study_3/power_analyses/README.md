This directory contains the R scripts and data simulations needed to reproduce the power analyses summarised and reported in the `Study_3_power_analyses.html` document. We have also created this document in PDF format (`Study_3_power_analyses.pdf`), so that it can be viewed on GitHub.

The R script `./code/power_analyses.R` was used to create the simulated datasets that are in the `./data` directory. These datasets were used for the power analyses. Running this script again will create new data simulations, which will lead to slightly different results.

The R Markdown script `./code/power_analyses.Rmd` creates the HTML file (`power_analyses.html`) that summarises and reports the results of the power analyses. The `./plots` directory provides JPG versions of all relevant plots.
