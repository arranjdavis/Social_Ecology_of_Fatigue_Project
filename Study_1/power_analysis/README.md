This directory contains the R scripts and data simulations needed to reproduce the power analysis summarised and reported in the `power_analysis.html` document.

The R script `./code/power_analysis.R` was used to create the simulated datasets that are in the `./data` directory. These datasets were used for the power analysis. Running this script again will create new data simulations, which will lead to slightly different results.

The R Markdown script `./code/power_analysis.Rmd` creates the HTML file (`power_analysis.html`) that summarises and reports the results of the power analysis. The `./plots` directory provides JPG versions of all plots presented in the `power_analysis.html` document.
